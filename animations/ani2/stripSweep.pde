/*

 StripSweep is an example of applying an animation to each individual
 strip within a structure. In this case, it moves a pixel from the
 starting point to the end point, and then starts over again.
 
 Since strip lengths are different, they'll begin to appear out of
 sync after the first pass.
 
 The class StripAnimation is embedded as an inner class of StripSweep.
 This acts as a data structure that will track the current position
 of the pixel for each strip.
 
 In StripSweep.update(), the animation positions are then applied
 to the local pg.
