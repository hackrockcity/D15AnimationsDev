# D15 Animation Tool Kit

This repo is for developing pure animations for D15 installations. This should include everything you need to get up and running for creating and running animations.

This repo does include a **simulator** for the teatro and asterix. Run the simulator sketch to see a virtual teatro/asterix installation.

## Libraries

The `/libraries` folder contains the required dependencies for these projects to run. Make sure you copy these into your Processing libraries folder. You can get the location of this folder in Processing Preferences.
